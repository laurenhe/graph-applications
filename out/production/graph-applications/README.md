# graph-applications

This is an implementation of a graph interface using an adjacency list representation.
It is designed to represent various graph types (e.g., directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted, cyclic/acyclic, etc). 

This graph data structure uses an interface to decouple the abstraction from the implementation. An adjacency list class is used here to implement the graph interface but an adjacency matrix could very well also be used.
